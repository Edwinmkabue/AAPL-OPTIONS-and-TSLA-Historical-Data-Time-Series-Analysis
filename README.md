# AAPL-OPTIONS-and-TSLA-Historical-Data-Time-Series-Analysis
This project aims to analyze options data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) extracted from the MarketWatch website. The data includes options data for AAPL with a 30-day maturity period and an expiration date of March 24, 2023. The project involves exploring the data and performing various calculations such as identifying the quantities τ = T − t and St, and computing the average bid and ask prices for both call and put options.

The project also involves applying the Black-Scholes formula to compute the theoretical prices of the call and put options based on the market parameters such as the current stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility. The theoretical prices are then compared to the market prices to identify any opportunities for arbitrage or mispricing.

Additionally, the project involves creating visualizations of the call and put options against the strike price using ggplot2. The graphs are used to identify any salient features observed from the data such as the distribution of the options prices with respect to the strike price.

Overall, the project provides an in-depth analysis of options data for AAPL and provides insights into the current market conditions and potential investment opportunities.
